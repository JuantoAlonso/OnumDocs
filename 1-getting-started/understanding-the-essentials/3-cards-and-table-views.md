# 3-Cards and Table Views

## Overview

In the [Listeners](/broken/pages/GYyURyXe1A9niyvozKTO), [Pipelines](/broken/pages/DYAGllTGDiM6UCbYQZw4), [Data sinks](/broken/pages/Mux29O4k4eugCz3t8QHo) and [Enrichment](/broken/pages/NlFLbWNapAv37QIMkUAu) areas, you can view all the resources in your Tenant as cards or in a table. Use the icons at the top right corner of the elements to switch between both modes.

In both views, you can:

* Use the search box to look for specific elements in the list.
* Display all the elements individually in a list or grouped by types, and order the elements as required. These grouping options vary depending on the area you are.

## Cards view

In this view, each element is displayed as a card that shows details about it.

* Click a card to open the details window, or double-click it to access the element and edit it. In the details window, you can click the **Add tag** button and add the required tags to an element. For each tag you enter in the box, hit the `Enter` key. Click **Save** to add the tags.
* Click the ellipsis button on each card to edit the element, copy its ID, or remove it.

Changes will be automatically applied. Click the **Reset** button to recover the original configuration.

## Order and group elements

* **Order by** - Order the elements by a specific criterion (alphabetically, creation date or update date).
* **Group by** - Group the elements in different categories. The categories you can choose may vary in each area of the platform (status, type, etc).&#x20;
