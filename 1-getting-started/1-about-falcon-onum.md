# 1-About Falcon Onum

## Overview

The exponential growth of data ingestion volumes can lead to reduced performance, slow response times, and increased costs. With this comes the need to implement optimization strategies & volume reduction control. We help you cut the noise of large data streams and reduce infrastructure by up to 80%.

Gain deep insights from any type of data, using any format, from any source.&#x20;

All of this...

### @ the Edge

By collecting and observing that data at the edge, as close as possible to where it’s being generated, gain real-time observations and take decisive action to prevent network downtime, payment system failures, malware infections, and more.

Unlike most tools that provide data observation and orchestration, Onum is not a data analytics space, which is already served well by security information and event management (SIEM) vendors and other analytics tools. Instead, Onum sits as close as possible to where the data is generated, and well in front of your analytics platforms, to collect and observe data across every aspect of your hybrid network.&#x20;
